        This template is strictly used for documentation requests, including:

        - Documenting new topics or features;
        - Elaborating on a specific subject in the DSA content;
        - Updating or fixing existing content;
        - Enhancing code examples or explanations;
        - Anything else that involves documentation but does not change the codebase.

        Before submitting an issue, please ensure:

        - You have checked the existing documentation to confirm the information is missing or needs updating.
        - For issues caused by incorrect behavior in code, use the "bug" template instead.

        If you are confident that your documentation request meets these criteria, you may also submit a pull request directly.
