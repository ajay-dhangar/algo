### Definition

Strand Sort is a recursive, comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by pulling out sorted sublists (strands) from the original list and then merging them together to create the final sorted list. **Strand Sort** works best with linked lists due to its insertions and extraction steps but can also be implemented with arrays.

---

### Characteristics

- **Type**: Comparison-based, Recursive
- **Stability**: Stable (preserves the relative order of equal elements)
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(n) (when the input list is already sorted)
  - **Average Case**: O(n²)
  - **Worst Case**: O(n²)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) (for merging sublists)

---

### How it Works

1. **Extract Strands**: A sorted sublist (strand) is repeatedly pulled out from the unsorted list by taking elements in increasing order.
2. **Merge**: Each extracted strand is merged into an existing sorted list.

#### Example:

Consider the list: `[4, 2, 5, 3, 8, 7, 6, 1]`

- The first strand will pull out `[4, 5, 8]` from the unsorted list.
- The second strand will pull out `[2, 3, 7]`.
- The remaining elements `[6, 1]` will form additional strands.
- The strands are merged together to form a sorted list.

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Function to merge two sorted vectors
vector<int> merge(vector<int>& list1, vector<int>& list2) {
    vector<int> result;
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < list1.size() && j < list2.size()) {
        if (list1[i] < list2[j]) {
            result.push_back(list1[i++]);
        } else {
            result.push_back(list2[j++]);
        }
    }

    // Add remaining elements of list1 or list2
    while (i < list1.size()) {
        result.push_back(list1[i++]);
    }
    while (j < list2.size()) {
        result.push_back(list2[j++]);
    }

    return result;
}

// Function to extract a strand from the list
vector<int> extractStrand(vector<int>& unsortedList) {
    vector<int> strand;
    strand.push_back(unsortedList[0]);
    unsortedList.erase(unsortedList.begin());

    for (auto it = unsortedList.begin(); it != unsortedList.end(); ) {
        if (*it >= strand.back()) {
            strand.push_back(*it);
            it = unsortedList.erase(it);
        } else {
            ++it;
        }
    }

    return strand;
}

// Function to perform strand sort
vector<int> strandSort(vector<int>& unsortedList) {
    vector<int> sortedList;

    while (!unsortedList.empty()) {
        vector<int> strand = extractStrand(unsortedList);
        sortedList = merge(sortedList, strand);
    }

    return sortedList;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> unsortedList = {4, 2, 5, 3, 8, 7, 6, 1};

    vector<int> sortedList = strandSort(unsortedList);

    cout << "Sorted list: ";
    for (int num : sortedList) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository or copy the code.
2. Compile the code using any C++ compiler, such as `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -o strand_sort strand_sort.cpp
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./strand_sort
   ```
4. The program will output the sorted list.

#### Example Output

```
Sorted list: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```

### Advantages

- Simple and intuitive.
- Stable sorting algorithm.
- Works well on data that has some presorted segments.

### Disadvantages

- Not efficient for large datasets due to its O(n²) time complexity in the average and worst case.
- Best suited for linked lists but can be adapted to arrays or vectors.
