In computer science, the **Naive Search Algorithm** (also known as brute-force search) is a basic string matching technique that checks every possible position in the text for the occurrence of a given pattern. Although simple to implement, it is inefficient for large texts and patterns as it performs comparisons one by one without any optimization.

## Overview

The **Naive Search Algorithm** (also known as brute-force search) is a basic string matching technique that checks every possible position in the text for the occurrence of a given pattern. Although simple to implement, it is inefficient for large texts and patterns as it performs comparisons one by one without any optimization.

### Time Complexity:
- **Worst Case:** O(n * m)  
Where:
- `n` is the length of the text.
- `m` is the length of the pattern.

## How It Works

1. The algorithm starts at the first character of the text.
2. It compares the pattern to a substring of the text of the same length.
3. If thereâ€™s a mismatch, it moves one position to the right and repeats the comparison.
4. If a match is found, it records the position.
5. This process continues until the entire text has been checked.

## Example

For the text `text = "abcabcabc"` and pattern `pattern = "abc"`, the naive search will compare:

- Compare `"abc"` with the first three characters: **Match** at index 0.
- Move to the next position and compare `"bca"`, then `"cab"`: **Mismatch**.
- Compare `"abc"` with the next `"abc"` at index 3: **Match**.

Thus, matches are found at indices 0 and 3.

## Code Implementation

### Python

```python
def naive_search(pattern, text):
    """Naive search algorithm for pattern matching.

    Args:
        pattern: The pattern string to search for.
        text: The text string where the pattern is to be searched.

    Returns:
        A list of starting indices where the pattern is found in the text.
    """
    m = len(pattern)
    n = len(text)
    result = []

    # Traverse the text and compare each substring of length m with the pattern
    for i in range(n - m + 1):
        if text[i:i + m] == pattern:
            result.append(i)

    return result

# Example usage
text = "abcabcabc"
pattern = "abc"
matches = naive_search(pattern, text)
print("Pattern found at indices:", matches)
```

### C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

vector<int> naive_search(string pattern, string text) {
    int m = pattern.length();
    int n = text.length();
    vector<int> result;

    // Traverse the text and compare each substring of length m with the pattern
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - m; i++) {
        bool match = true;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (text[i + j] != pattern[j]) {
                match = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (match) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    string text = "abcabcabc";
    string pattern = "abc";

    vector<int> matches = naive_search(pattern, text);
    cout << "Pattern found at indices: ";
    for (int index : matches)
        cout << index << " ";
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Limitations

- **Efficiency:** The algorithm performs O(n * m) comparisons in the worst case, which is inefficient for large texts and patterns.
- **No Optimization:** Unlike more advanced algorithms like Rabin-Karp or Knuth-Morris-Pratt, the naive search algorithm does not use any hashing or preprocessing to improve search times.

## Applications

- **Educational Use:** Due to its simplicity, the naive search is often used to introduce pattern matching algorithms.
- **Small-scale Search Problems:** Suitable for small text searches or when efficiency is not a primary concern.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** The naive search algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n * m)$ in the worst case, where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity of the algorithm is $O(1)$ as it does not require any additional space apart from the input strings.

The naive search algorithm is a simple and intuitive approach to pattern matching but is not suitable for large-scale applications due to its inefficiency. More advanced algorithms like Rabin-Karp, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, or Boyer-Moore are preferred for real-world scenarios.
