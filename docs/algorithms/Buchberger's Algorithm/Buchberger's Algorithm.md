### Definition

**Buchberger's Algorithm** is used to compute the Gröbner Basis for an ideal in a polynomial ring, which is essential in solving systems of polynomial equations and performing symbolic algebraic computations. The algorithm iteratively computes the S-polynomial of polynomial pairs and reduces it until a basis for the ideal is found.

### Characteristics

- **Algorithm Type**: Symbolic computation, Gröbner Basis computation.
- **Main Operation**: Computes the S-polynomial of polynomial pairs and reduces them.
- **Data Structures**: A vector of polynomials is maintained during the computation.
- **Output**: A Gröbner Basis for the input polynomials.

### Time Complexity

- **Average Case**: The complexity depends on the degree of the polynomials and the number of terms. The algorithm can have exponential time complexity in the worst case.
- **Worst Case**: $O(n^3)$ or more, depending on the implementation and the number of polynomials involved.


### Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of polynomials. The space is required to store the polynomials and their intermediate results.

### Approach

1. **Input**: Start with a set of polynomials.
2. **Compute S-polynomial**: For every pair of polynomials in the set, compute their S-polynomial.
3. **Reduce S-polynomial**: Divide the S-polynomial by the existing polynomials and check the remainder. If the remainder is non-zero, add it to the set of polynomials.
4. **Repeat**: Continue this process until no new polynomials are generated, i.e., until the basis converges.
5. **Output Gröbner Basis**: The set of polynomials that have been reduced is the Gröbner basis for the ideal.
