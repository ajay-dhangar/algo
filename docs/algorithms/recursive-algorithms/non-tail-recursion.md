# Non-Tail Recursion

## Definition
Non-tail recursion occurs when a recursive function performs some operations **after** making the recursive call. In contrast to tail recursion, where the recursive call is the final action in the function, non-tail recursion does not allow for optimization techniques like tail-call optimization because the function needs to retain its current state until further operations are completed.

## Why It Is Useful
- **Post-processing**: Non-tail recursion is useful in scenarios where the function needs to do some work after the recursive call, such as aggregating results or performing cleanup.
- **Natural fit for divide-and-conquer**: Algorithms like merge sort or tree traversal require post-processing, making non-tail recursion essential.
- **Simpler logic**: Problems like calculating factorial, Fibonacci, or solving complex mathematical equations often become easier to understand and implement with non-tail recursion.

## Time Complexity Analysis

### Example 1: Factorial Calculation

**Function:**
```txt
factorial(n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return 1;
    else
        return n * factorial(n-1);
}
```

## Best Case
In the best case, the function will stop as soon as the base condition is met (n == 0). This happens in constant time:

**Best-case complexity: O(1).**
## Worst Case
In the worst case, the function will recurse n times, leading to:

**Worst-case complexity: O(n).**

## Example of Non-Tail Recursion: Factorial Calculation

### Dry Run

**Input:** `n = 3`

1. `factorial(3)` calls `factorial(2)` -> `3 * factorial(2)`
2. `factorial(2)` calls `factorial(1)` -> `2 * factorial(1)`
3. `factorial(1)` calls `factorial(0)` -> `1 * factorial(0)`
4. `factorial(0)` returns `1`
5. `factorial(1)` returns `1 * 1 = 1`
6. `factorial(2)` returns `2 * 1 = 2`
7. `factorial(3)` returns `3 * 2 = 6`

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Non-Tail Recursion

### Advantages
1. **Easier to Implement**: 
   - Non-tail recursion often leads to simpler and more intuitive code for certain problems, especially when the problem requires combining results from recursive calls.

2. **Preserves State**: 
   - Intermediate results are maintained in the call stack, allowing for complex operations after recursive calls without needing additional data structures.

3. **Natural for Certain Algorithms**: 
   - Many algorithms, like tree traversals and divide-and-conquer algorithms (e.g., merge sort), are more naturally expressed using non-tail recursion.

4. **Flexibility**: 
   - It can handle problems that involve multiple recursive calls or those that need post-processing of results from recursive calls.

### Disadvantages
1. **Higher Memory Usage**: 
   - Non-tail recursion consumes more stack space because each call adds a new frame to the call stack, which can lead to stack overflow for deep recursion.

2. **Performance Overhead**: 
   - The overhead of maintaining multiple active frames on the stack can slow down execution, especially compared to tail recursion, which can be optimized by compilers.

3. **Limited Optimization**: 
   - Non-tail recursive functions cannot take advantage of tail call optimization (TCO), which reduces the function's call stack depth and enhances performance.

4. **Complex Debugging**: 
   - Debugging non-tail recursive functions can be more challenging due to the multiple active states on the call stack, making it harder to track values and flow of execution.



# Code Implementation:

### C Implementation :

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);  // Non-tail recursion
}

int main() {
    int num = 3;
    printf("Factorial of %d is %d\n", num, factorial(num));
    return 0;
}
```

### Python Implementation :

```c
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Non-tail recursion

num = 3
print(f"Factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}")
```

### Java Implementation :

```c
public class Factorial {
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        if (n == 0)
            return 1;
        return n * factorial(n - 1);  // Non-tail recursion
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 3;
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + num + " is " + factorial(num));
    }
}
```
