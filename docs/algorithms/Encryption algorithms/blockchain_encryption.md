### Definition:

Blockchain cryptography refers to the cryptographic algorithms and techniques used to secure and verify the integrity of transactions in blockchain systems. These cryptographic methods ensure that data within the blockchain is tamper-proof, decentralized, and transparent, enabling trust between parties without the need for intermediaries.

### Characteristics:

- **Immutable Ledger**:
  - Cryptography ensures that once data is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted without consensus, maintaining an immutable and transparent ledger.

- **Decentralization**:
  - Blockchain cryptography allows for decentralized trust, eliminating the need for central authorities or intermediaries to verify transactions.

- **Hash Functions**:
  - Cryptographic hash functions are essential in blockchain to secure block information, verify data integrity, and create unique digital fingerprints for each block.

- **Digital Signatures**:
  - Digital signatures using asymmetric cryptography ensure the authenticity of transactions, allowing users to sign transactions with their private keys, which can be verified with their public keys.

- **Common Algorithms**:
  - Algorithms like SHA-256 (used in Bitcoin), ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), and other cryptographic techniques are commonly used in blockchain systems to secure data and transactions.

### Time Complexity:

- **Hashing Time**: $O(n)$  
  The time complexity of hashing in blockchain is linear in relation to the size of the data being hashed. SHA-256, for example, processes blocks of data in constant time per block.

- **Verification Time**: $O(1)$  
  Verifying digital signatures or hashes is generally constant-time, making it efficient for validating transactions and data integrity in blockchain systems.

### Space Complexity:

- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$  
  Blockchain systems store hashed data, transaction signatures, and block information. The space complexity is proportional to the number of blocks, transactions, and data stored.

### Cryptographic Algorithms in Blockchain:

1. **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)**:
   - SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function used to secure and link blocks in Bitcoin and other blockchains. It produces a 256-bit hash, ensuring data integrity and tamper-resistance.

2. **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**:
   - ECDSA is a public key cryptographic algorithm used for generating and verifying digital signatures in blockchain networks, offering security with smaller key sizes than RSA.

3. **Merkle Trees**:
   - Merkle trees use hashing to efficiently verify large amounts of data in a blockchain. Each leaf node is hashed, and then their hashes are combined pairwise to form parent hashes, creating a single root hash that represents all transactions.

4. **Public/Private Key Cryptography**:
   - In blockchain, a public-private key pair is used for authentication. Users sign transactions with their private keys, and the network verifies these transactions using the public key, ensuring data authenticity.

### C++ Implementation of Blockchain Cryptography (SHA-256 Example):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <openssl/sha.h>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

// Function to calculate the SHA-256 hash of a given input string
std::string sha256(const std::string& input) {
    unsigned char hash[SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH];
    SHA256_CTX sha256;
    SHA256_Init(&sha256);
    SHA256_Update(&sha256, input.c_str(), input.size());
    SHA256_Final(hash, &sha256);

    std::stringstream ss;
    for (int i = 0; i < SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH; ++i) {
        ss << std::hex << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << (int)hash[i];
    }
    return ss.str();
}

int main() {
    std::string input = "Blockchain Example";
    std::string output = sha256(input);

    std::cout << "Input: " << input << std::endl;
    std::cout << "SHA-256 Hash: " << output << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **SHA-256 Hashing**: This C++ implementation demonstrates how to use the OpenSSL library to calculate the SHA-256 hash of a given input string. Hashing is a fundamental part of blockchain cryptography, securing the integrity of each block's data.

### Summary:

Blockchain cryptography is the backbone of blockchain technology, ensuring the security, integrity, and decentralization of the system. By employing techniques like hash functions, digital signatures, and public/private key cryptography, blockchain creates an immutable and transparent ledger for secure data storage and transactions. Cryptographic algorithms like SHA-256 and ECDSA are foundational in enabling the trustless and decentralized nature of blockchain systems. As blockchain continues to evolve, cryptographic methods will remain crucial for maintaining its security and resilience against attacks.
