### Definition:

Post-quantum encryption (PQE) refers to cryptographic algorithms designed to withstand the threat posed by quantum computers. Quantum computers can potentially break current encryption methods (e.g., RSA and ECC) using quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm. PQE ensures data remains secure in a future where quantum computers are powerful enough to compromise existing cryptography.

### Characteristics:

- *Quantum-Resistant*:
  - Post-quantum encryption algorithms are developed to be secure against quantum attacks, unlike traditional cryptographic algorithms, which can be easily broken by quantum computers.

- *Mathematical Complexity*:
  - These algorithms rely on mathematical problems that are hard for both classical and quantum computers, such as lattice-based problems, multivariate polynomial problems, and code-based problems.

- *Larger Key Sizes*:
  - To ensure quantum resistance, post-quantum cryptographic algorithms typically require larger key sizes, which increase both storage and computational costs.

- *Common Algorithms*:
  - Algorithms like lattice-based cryptography (e.g., NTRU, Kyber), code-based cryptography (e.g., McEliece), and hash-based cryptography (e.g., SPHINCS+) are popular candidates for post-quantum encryption.

### Time Complexity:

- *Encryption/Decryption Time*: $O(n^k)$  
  The time complexity for post-quantum encryption can vary depending on the algorithm used. Most post-quantum algorithms have a higher time complexity compared to classical algorithms due to the need for complex operations and larger key sizes.

### Space Complexity:

- *Space Complexity*: $O(n)$ to $O(n^2)$  
  Post-quantum encryption requires more storage due to larger key sizes and ciphertexts. Some algorithms, especially lattice-based ones, can significantly increase space requirements compared to traditional cryptography.

### Types of Post-Quantum Encryption Algorithms:

1. *Lattice-Based Cryptography*:
   - Lattice-based encryption is one of the most promising post-quantum encryption methods. Algorithms like *Kyber* and *NTRU* rely on the hardness of lattice problems, offering security against quantum attacks.

2. *Code-Based Cryptography*:
   - *McEliece* is a well-known example of code-based encryption that uses error-correcting codes to encrypt messages, offering resistance to quantum attacks.

3. *Hash-Based Cryptography*:
   - *SPHINCS+* is a quantum-resistant signature scheme that uses hash functions and is secure against both classical and quantum attacks.

4. *Multivariate Quadratic Equations (MQ)*:
   - Cryptosystems based on the hardness of solving systems of multivariate quadratic equations over finite fields. Examples include the *HFE* (Hidden Field Equations) family of cryptosystems.

### C++ Example of Post-Quantum Encryption (Kyber Example):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <oqs/oqs.h>

int main() {
    if (!OQS_KEM_alg_is_enabled(OQS_KEM_alg_kyber_512)) {
        std::cerr << "Kyber-512 is not enabled in this build." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    OQS_KEM *kem = OQS_KEM_new(OQS_KEM_alg_kyber_512);
    if (kem == nullptr) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to initialize Kyber-512." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Key generation
    uint8_t public_key[OQS_KEM_public_key_length(kem)];
    uint8_t secret_key[OQS_KEM_secret_key_length(kem)];
    OQS_KEM_keypair(kem, public_key, secret_key);

    std::cout << "Key pair generated successfully!" << std::endl;

    // Message encryption
    uint8_t ciphertext[OQS_KEM_ciphertext_length(kem)];
    uint8_t shared_secret_enc[OQS_KEM_shared_secret_length(kem)];
    OQS_KEM_encaps(kem, ciphertext, shared_secret_enc, public_key);

    std::cout << "Message encrypted successfully!" << std::endl;

    // Message decryption
    uint8_t shared_secret_dec[OQS_KEM_shared_secret_length(kem)];
    OQS_KEM_decaps(kem, shared_secret_dec, ciphertext, secret_key);

    std::cout << "Message decrypted successfully!" << std::endl;

    OQS_KEM_free(kem);

    return 0;
}
```

:::note
This example uses the *liboqs* library, which implements several quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms. You need to install the library and set up your C++ environment to compile and run the code.

### Summary:

Post-quantum encryption represents the future of cryptography in a quantum computing world. With quantum computers potentially capable of breaking traditional encryption schemes, post-quantum cryptographic algorithms like lattice-based, code-based, and hash-based cryptography provide the necessary security. While post-quantum encryption algorithms may require larger keys and more computational resources, their importance in protecting sensitive information against future quantum attacks cannot be overstated.
