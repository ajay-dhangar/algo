## Product of Array Except Self

The **Product of Array Except Self** problem involves computing an output array such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of the input array except for `input[i]`. 

### Problem Statement

### Constraints
- You must solve it in O(n) time complexity.
- You cannot use the division operation.

## Algorithm

1. Create an output array of the same length as `nums`.
2. Initialize a variable `left` to 1.
3. Populate the output array with the product of all elements to the left of each index.
4. Initialize another variable `right` to 1.
5. Populate the output array with the product of all elements to the right of each index.
6. Return the output array.

## Pseudocode

```plaintext title="Product of Array Except Self"
procedure productExceptSelf( nums : list of integers )
    n = length(nums)
    output = array of size n

    left = 1
    for i = 0 to n - 1 do
        output[i] = left
        left *= nums[i]

    right = 1
    for i = n - 1 down to 0 do
        output[i] *= right
        right *= nums[i]

    return output
end procedure


```

### C++ Implementation:

```cpp

// Product of Array Except Self
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> sum(vector<int> &arr)
{
    int n = arr.size();
    vector<int> ans(n, 1); // Initialize ans array with 1's.

    // Calculate prefix products
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    {
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] * arr[i - 1]; // ans[i] is the product of all elements before arr[i].
    }

    int suffix = 1; // Initialize suffix product.
    // Calculate suffix products and multiply with prefix products
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--)
    {
        suffix *= arr[i + 1]; // Update suffix to be the product of elements after arr[i].
        ans[i] *= suffix;     // Multiply the current ans[i] (prefix product) by the suffix product.
    }
    return ans;
}

// Main Function
int main()
{
    vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    vector<int> res = sum(arr); // calling function
    for (int val : res)
    {
        cout << val << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}

```

### JAVA Implementation:

```java

public class ProductExceptSelf {
    public static int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] output = new int[n];

        // Step 1: Calculate prefix products
        output[0] = 1; // The first prefix product is always 1
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            output[i] = output[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
        }
        // Step 2: Calculate suffix products and multiply with prefix
        int suffix = 1;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            output[i] *= suffix;
            suffix *= nums[i];
        }
        return output;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int[] result = productExceptSelf(nums);
        for (int value : result) {
            System.out.print(value + " "); // Output: 24 12 8 6
        }
    }
}

```

### Python Implementation:
```py

def product_except_self(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    output = [1] * n

    # Step 1: Calculate prefix products
    for i in range(1, n):
        output[i] = output[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]

    # Step 2: Calculate suffix products and multiply with prefix
    suffix = 1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        output[i] *= suffix
        suffix *= nums[i]

    return output

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = product_except_self(nums)
print(result)  # Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]

```


### JavaScript Code Implementation

```javascript
function productExceptSelf(arr) {
    const n = arr.length;
    const ans = new Array(n).fill(1); // Initialize ans array with 1's.

    // Calculate prefix products
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] * arr[i - 1]; // ans[i] is the product of all elements before arr[i].
    }

    let suffix = 1; // Initialize suffix product.
    // Calculate suffix products and multiply with prefix products
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        suffix *= arr[i + 1]; // Update suffix to be the product of elements after arr[i].
        ans[i] *= suffix;     // Multiply the current ans[i] (prefix product) by the suffix product.
    }
    
    return ans;
}

// Example usage
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const res = productExceptSelf(arr); // calling function
console.log(res.join(" ")); // Output the result
```

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if we use the output array directly for left and right products (optimized version).

> **Note**: The above implementation uses O(n) space for the output array.

## Explanation

To find the output array where each element at index `i` is the product of all the numbers in the input array except the one at `i`, we can utilize prefix and suffix products.

### Step-by-step Breakdown

1. **Initial Array**: 
   We start with the input array:  
   `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

2. **Calculate Prefix Products**:
   - We create an output array initialized with 1's:  
   `output = [1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - The prefix product at each index is calculated as follows:
     - For index 0:  
       `output[0] = 1` (no elements to the left)
     - For index 1:  
       `output[1] = output[0] * 1 = 1 * 1 = 1`
     - For index 2:  
       `output[2] = output[1] * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2`
     - For index 3:  
       `output[3] = output[2] * 3 = 2 * 3 = 6`

   After calculating the prefix products, we get:  
   `output = [1, 1, 2, 6]`

3. **Calculate Suffix Products**:
   - We now iterate from the end of the array to the beginning to calculate the suffix products:
   - Initialize a variable for the suffix product:
     - `suffix = 1`
   - Update the output array while multiplying by the suffix product:
     - For index 3:  
       `output[3] = output[3] * suffix = 6 * 1 = 6`  
       Update suffix: `suffix = suffix * 4 = 4`
     - For index 2:  
       `output[2] = output[2] * suffix = 2 * 4 = 8`  
       Update suffix: `suffix = suffix * 3 = 12`
     - For index 1:  
       `output[1] = output[1] * suffix = 1 * 12 = 12`  
       Update suffix: `suffix = suffix * 2 = 24`
     - For index 0:  
       `output[0] = output[0] * suffix = 1 * 24 = 24`  
       Update suffix: `suffix = suffix * 1 = 24`

   After calculating the suffix products, we get:  
   `output = [24, 12, 8, 6]`

### Final Output

Thus, the output for the input array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is:  
`[24, 12, 8, 6]`

- `output[0] = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24`
- `output[1] = 1 * 3 * 4 = 12`
- `output[2] = 1 * 2 * 4 = 8`
- `output[3] = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6`


### Note

This problem is commonly asked in coding interviews and is a great way to understand how to manipulate arrays without using division.
