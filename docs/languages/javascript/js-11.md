# Closures in JavaScript

Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, enabling functions to retain access to variables from their outer scope even after the outer function has finished execution. This behavior is crucial in many advanced JavaScript patterns like callbacks, event handlers, and function factories.

## What is a Closure?

A **closure** is created when a function is defined inside another function and that inner function has access to the outer function's variables. The inner function "remembers" the environment in which it was created, even after the outer function has returned.

## Key Concepts:
1. **Lexical Scope**: Functions can access variables from their parent scope.
2. **Retention of Variables**: Inner functions retain access to variables in the outer function, even after the outer function has completed.

## Example: Basic Closure

```javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0; // outer function variable
  return function inner() { // inner function
    count++; // modifying the outer variable
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = outer();
counter(); // Output: 1
counter(); // Output: 2
```

In this example, the inner function inner retains access to the variable count from the outer function outer, even after outer has returned.

## Real-World Use Cases:
- Private Variables: Encapsulating data and exposing only whatâ€™s necessary.
- Callback Functions: Retaining state within event handlers or asynchronous operations.
- Function Factories: Creating customized functions.

## Example: Closure for Private Variables

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0; // private variable
  return {
    increment: function() {
      count++;
      console.log(count);
    },
    reset: function() {
      count = 0;
      console.log("Counter reset");
    }
  };
}

const myCounter = createCounter();
myCounter.increment(); // Output: 1
myCounter.increment(); // Output: 2
myCounter.reset();     // Output: Counter reset
```

In this example, count remains private to the createCounter function but can be manipulated through the increment and reset methods.
