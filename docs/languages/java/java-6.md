## Overview
In Java, classes are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP). A class is essentially a blueprint or template that defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of objects. It provides a way to encapsulate data and functions together, allowing for code modularity, reuse, and better organization.

Classes in Java define the structure and behavior of objects, specifying what data they can hold and what operations they can perform. Each instance of a class (known as an object) represents a specific implementation of that class.

## What Is a Class?
A class in Java is a user-defined data type that serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. Classes contain:
- **Fields (Instance Variables)**: These represent the state or attributes of an object.
- **Methods**: These define the actions or behaviors of the object.
- **Constructors**: Special methods used for initializing objects.

## Syntax
The basic syntax for defining a class in Java is as follows:

```java
access_modifier class ClassName {
    // Fields (attributes)
    data_type fieldName;

    // Methods (behaviors)
    return_type methodName(parameters) {
        // Method body
    }

    // Constructor
    ClassName(parameters) {
        // Constructor body
    }
}
```
## Key Points
- **Encapsulation:** Classes encapsulate data (fields) and behavior (methods), promoting data hiding and modularity.
- **Constructors:** Special methods that initialize the object’s fields. If no constructor is defined, Java provides a default constructor.
- **Access Modifiers:** Classes can have different access levels (public, private, etc.) to control their visibility.

## Conclusion
Classes are a core concept in Java’s object-oriented programming model, allowing developers to define the structure and behavior of objects. Understanding how to define, instantiate, and manipulate classes is essential for building Java applications. By mastering classes, you lay the foundation for using advanced OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
