Hey there! In this guide, we'll explore decorators in Python. Decorators are a powerful and flexible way to modify the behavior of functions or methods. They allow you to add functionality to existing code in a clean and readable way. Let's dive in!

## Python Decorators

- **Function Modification**: Decorators allow you to extend or modify the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Decorators are often implemented as higher-order functions, meaning they take another function as an argument.

## 1. Defining a Simple Decorator

You can define a simple decorator by creating a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function.

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper
```

## 2. Applying a Decorator

You can apply a decorator to a function using the `@decorator_name` syntax above the function definition.

```python
@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()  # Output:
# Something is happening before the function is called.
# Hello!
# Something is happening after the function is called.
```

## 3. Decorators with Arguments

You can create decorators that accept arguments by defining another level of nested functions.

```python
def repeat(num_times):
    def decorator_repeat(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(num_times):
                func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator_repeat

@repeat(3)
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # Output:
# Hello, Alice!
# Hello, Alice!
# Hello, Alice!
```

## 4. Using `functools.wraps`

When creating decorators, it's a good practice to use `functools.wraps` to preserve the original function's metadata.

```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    """This function says hello."""
    print("Hello!")

print(say_hello.__name__)  # Output: say_hello
print(say_hello.__doc__)   # Output: This function says hello.
```

## 5. Chaining Decorators

You can apply multiple decorators to a single function by stacking them.

```python
def decorator_one(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Decorator One")
        func()
    return wrapper

def decorator_two(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Decorator Two")
        func()
    return wrapper

@decorator_one
@decorator_two
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()  # Output:
# Decorator One
# Decorator Two
# Hello!
```
