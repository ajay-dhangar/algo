Hey everyone! Today, we're going to dive into the usage of operators in Python. Whether you're just starting or looking to expand your knowledge, this guide will walk you through the most common operators in Python. Let's jump right in!
# Python Operators


* Python supports various types of operators to perform different kinds of operations on variables and values.

* These operators are grouped into several categories.
## 1. Arithmetic Operators


These operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.  
```python  
x = 10                                        # Initialize x  
y = 5                                         # Initialize y  
add = x + y                                  # Addition: 10 + 5 = 15  
sub = x - y                                  # Subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5  
mul = x * y                                  # Multiplication: 10 * 5 = 50  
div = x / y                                  # Division: 10 / 5 = 2.0  
mod = x % y                                  # Modulus: 10 % 5 = 0  
exp = x ** y                                 # Exponentiation: 10 ** 5 = 100000  
floordiv = x // y                            # Floor division: 10 // 5 = 2  
```
## 2. Comparison Operators


These operators are used to compare two values, and they return a Boolean result.  
```python  
x = 10                                        # Initialize x  
y = 5                                         # Initialize y  
eq = (x == y)                                # Equal to: False  
ne = (x != y)                                # Not equal to: True  
gt = (x > y)                                 # Greater than: True  
lt = (x < y)                                 # Less than: False  
ge = (x >= y)                                # Greater than or equal to: True  
le = (x <= y)                                # Less than or equal to: False  
```
## 3. Logical Operators


These operators are used to combine conditional statements.  
```python  
a = True                                     # Initialize a  
b = False                                    # Initialize b  
logical_and = (a and b)                      # Logical AND: False  
logical_or = (a or b)                        # Logical OR: True  
logical_not = not a                          # Logical NOT: False  
```
## 4. Assignment Operators


These operators are used to assign values to variables.  
```python  
x = 10                                       # Assign 10 to x  
x += 5                                       # Add and assign: x = x + 5 -> 15  
x -= 3                                       # Subtract and assign: x = x - 3 -> 12  
x *= 2                                       # Multiply and assign: x = x * 2 -> 24  
x /= 4                                       # Divide and assign: x = x / 4 -> 6.0  
x %= 3                                       # Modulus and assign: x = x % 3 -> 0  
x //= 2                                      # Floor divide and assign: x = x // 2 -> 0  
x **= 3                                      # Exponentiation and assign: x = x ** 3 -> 0  
```
## 5. Bitwise Operators


These operators work on bits and perform bit-level operations.  
```python  
x = 6                                        # Binary: 110  
y = 3                                        # Binary: 011  
bitwise_and = x & y                          # Bitwise AND: 010 -> 2  
bitwise_or = x | y                           # Bitwise OR: 111 -> 7  
bitwise_xor = x ^ y                          # Bitwise XOR: 101 -> 5  
bitwise_not = ~x                             # Bitwise NOT: 001 -> -7 (two's complement)  
shift_left = x << 2                          # Left shift: 110 << 2 -> 11000 -> 24  
shift_right = x >> 2                         # Right shift: 110 >> 2 -> 001 -> 1  
```
## 6. Membership Operators


These operators test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples.  
```python  
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]                      # Define a list  
is_in = 2 in my_list                        # Check if 2 is in the list: True  
is_not_in = 5 not in my_list                # Check if 5 is not in the list: True  
```
## 7. Identity Operators


These operators compare the memory locations of two objects.  
```python  
x = 5                                        # Initialize x  
y = 5                                        # Initialize y  
is_identical = (x is y)                      # Check if x and y refer to the same object: True  
is_not_identical = (x is not y)              # Check if x and y refer to different objects: False  
```
