## Introduction

Naive Bayes is a family of probabilistic algorithms based on Bayes' theorem, primarily used for classification tasks in machine learning. It operates under the assumption that the features are independent given the class label, which simplifies calculations and allows for efficient training and prediction. Naive Bayes is particularly effective in scenarios where the dimensionality of the data is high, making it suitable for applications such as:

- **Text Classification:** Categorizing emails as spam or not spam.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment of customer reviews.
- **Medical Diagnosis:** Classifying diseases based on symptoms.

The simplicity and speed of Naive Bayes make it a popular choice for many practical applications.

## How It Works

Naive Bayes classifiers use Bayes' theorem to predict the probability of each class given the input features. The steps involved are:

1. **Calculate Prior Probabilities:** Determine the prior probability of each class based on training data.
2. **Calculate Likelihood:** For each feature, compute the likelihood of observing that feature given each class.
3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:** Combine the prior probabilities and likelihoods to calculate the posterior probability for each class using:
   $$
   P(C|X) = \frac{P(X|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(X)}
   $$
   where $$C$$ is a class and $$X$$ represents the features.
4. **Make Predictions:** Assign the class with the highest posterior probability to the input data.

This process allows Naive Bayes to efficiently classify data points based on their features.

## Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers

### Gaussian Naive Bayes
Assumes that features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. It is suitable for continuous data.

### Multinomial Naive Bayes
Designed for discrete counts, often used in text classification where features represent word counts or frequencies.

### Bernoulli Naive Bayes
Similar to Multinomial, but assumes binary features (presence or absence of a feature), making it effective for binary classification tasks.

## Benefits and Use Cases

### Benefits
1. **Simplicity:** Easy to implement and understand, making it accessible for beginners.
2. **Efficiency:** Fast training and prediction times, especially with large datasets.
3. **Performance:** Often performs surprisingly well even with strong independence assumptions.

### Use Cases
- **Spam Detection:** Classifying emails as spam or not based on content.
- **Document Categorization:** Automatically categorizing articles or papers into predefined topics.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Suggesting products based on user behavior and preferences.

## Implementation

### Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

### Code
Below is a Python implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier using `scikit-learn`.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample dataset: Features (X) and Labels (y)
data = {
    'Feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Feature2': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    'Label': [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  # Binary classification
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
X = df[['Feature1', 'Feature2']]
y = df['Label']

# Step 1: Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 2: Create and train the Naive Bayes classifier
model = GaussianNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 3: Make predictions on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 4: Evaluate model accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

## Example

### Sample Data
Using a simple dataset with two features:
```python
data = {
    'Feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Feature2': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    'Label': [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Data Preparation:** The dataset is organized into features and labels.
2. **Train-Test Split:** The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
3. **Model Training:** The Gaussian Naive Bayes model is trained using the training set.
4. **Prediction and Evaluation:** Predictions are made on the test set and accuracy is computed.

### Output
The algorithm will print the accuracy of the classifier on the test set.

## Running the Code

1. **Run the Code:** Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., `naive_bayes.py`) and execute:
    ```bash
    python naive_bayes.py
    ```
2. **Observe Output:** Check the terminal output for model accuracy.
