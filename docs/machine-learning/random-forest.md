### Definition:
The **Random Forest Algorithm** is a versatile and widely-used ensemble learning technique that builds multiple decision trees during training and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and robustness. This algorithm is applicable to both **classification** and **regression** tasks. The core idea behind random forests is that by averaging or "voting" across many decision trees, the overall prediction is more reliable and less prone to overfitting compared to individual trees.

### Characteristics:
- **Ensemble Learning**:  
  Random forest is an ensemble method, meaning it aggregates the outputs of many decision trees to make a final prediction, which helps to enhance performance and reduce overfitting.
  
- **Randomness in Trees**:  
  The algorithm introduces randomness in two main ways: it selects random subsets of features at each split, and it trains each tree on a random subset of the training data (with replacement, known as **bootstrap sampling**). This leads to diverse trees, improving model accuracy.

- **Robustness**:  
  Random forest is robust against overfitting, especially when compared to single decision trees. It can handle missing values, and because it averages predictions, it is less sensitive to noise in the data.

### Types of Random Forest:
1. **Classification Forest**:  
   Used when the target variable is categorical (e.g., yes/no, dog/cat). It uses majority voting across multiple trees to assign a class label.
   
2. **Regression Forest**:  
   Used when the target variable is continuous (e.g., predicting a price). It takes the average of the predictions from all the trees to generate a final output.

### Steps Involved:
1. **Bootstrap Sampling**:  
   For each tree, the algorithm randomly selects a subset of the training data with replacement (bootstrapping). This ensures each tree is trained on different data, promoting diversity among the trees.
   
2. **Feature Randomness**:  
   At each node of a tree, a random subset of features is selected to find the best possible split. This further diversifies the trees and prevents overfitting.
   
3. **Grow Decision Trees**:  
   Each tree is grown to its maximum depth without pruning. However, individual trees may be weak, but the ensemble (forest) of many trees is strong.
   
4. **Aggregate Results**:  
   For classification tasks, the forest takes a majority vote across all trees to decide the final class. For regression tasks, it takes the average of the predictions from all trees.

### Problem Statement:
Given a dataset with features and target values, the goal is to build a random forest that can **classify** data points into categories or **predict** continuous values by leveraging the power of multiple decision trees.

### Key Concepts:
- **Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging)**:  
  This technique trains each tree on a randomly selected subset of the dataset (with replacement), promoting diversity in the ensemble.
  
- **Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error**:  
  Since each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, about one-third of the data is not used during training and can be used to estimate the model’s accuracy (out-of-bag error) without the need for a separate validation set.
  
- **Majority Voting (for Classification)**:  
  The final prediction for a classification task is based on the class that gets the most votes from the trees.

- **Averaging (for Regression)**:  
  The final prediction for a regression task is the average of the predictions from all trees.

### Split Criteria:
- **Gini Impurity**:  
  Like in decision trees, Gini impurity is used for evaluating splits in classification problems. It measures how often a randomly chosen element would be misclassified if it was randomly labeled.
  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:  
  For regression tasks, the mean squared error is used to find the optimal splits that minimize the variance between predicted and actual values.

### Time Complexity:
- **Training Complexity**:  
  For a random forest of `T` trees, each trained on `n` samples and with `d` features, the time complexity for training is approximately $O(T \cdot n \cdot d \cdot \log n)$.
  
- **Prediction Complexity**:  
  For making predictions, each tree in the forest contributes, so the complexity is $O(T \cdot \log n)$ for a forest with `T` trees and `n` data points.

### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**:  
  The space complexity is $O(T \cdot n \cdot d)$ due to the storage of `T` trees, each with `n` samples and `d` features.

### Example:
Consider a dataset to classify whether a customer will churn based on factors like age, income, and customer activity:

- Dataset:
| Age | Income | Active | Churned |
|-----|--------|--------|---------|
| 25  | High   | Yes    | No      |
| 45  | Medium | No     | Yes     |
| 35  | Low    | Yes    | No      |
| 22  | Low    | No     | Yes     |



Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Bootstrap Sampling**:  
 Each tree gets a random sample of the data to train on, with some data points potentially appearing multiple times in the sample.
 
2. **Random Feature Selection**:  
 At each node, a random subset of features (e.g., Age or Income) is selected to find the best split.

3. **Grow Trees**:  
 Each tree grows fully, creating a deep structure that may not generalize well individually but contributes to the overall accuracy when combined.

4. **Aggregate Predictions**:  
 After all trees are grown, the final prediction is made based on the majority vote for classification tasks or averaging for regression tasks.

### Python Implementation:
Here is a basic implementation of a Random Forest in Python using **scikit-learn**:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create Random Forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```
