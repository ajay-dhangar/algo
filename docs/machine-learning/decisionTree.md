### Definition:
The **Decision Tree Algorithm** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks. It splits data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents an outcome (class label or continuous value).

### Characteristics:
- **Recursive Partitioning**:  
  A decision tree recursively splits the dataset based on specific conditions (features) to form a tree structure that leads to a prediction at each leaf node.

- **Interpretability**:  
  Decision trees are highly interpretable because the decision-making process is clear and transparent. You can easily follow the path of decisions from root to leaf to understand how a prediction is made.

- **Non-parametric**:  
  This algorithm doesnâ€™t make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution, making it suitable for a variety of datasets.

### Types of Decision Trees:
1. **Classification Tree**:  
   Used when the target variable is categorical (e.g., yes/no, spam/ham). It predicts the class label based on the features.
   
2. **Regression Tree**:  
   Used when the target variable is continuous (e.g., predicting a price). It predicts a real number based on the features.

### Steps Involved:
1. **Choose the Best Split**:  
   The dataset is split based on the feature that maximizes some criteria. For classification, **Gini Index** or **Entropy** (used in information gain) is commonly used. For regression, **mean squared error** is often the criterion.
   
2. **Recursively Split**:  
   The process is repeated recursively for each subset, creating branches until no further meaningful splits can be made (e.g., when the data is perfectly classified or a stopping criterion like maximum depth is reached).
   
3. **Assign Leaf Nodes**:  
   Once the splitting stops, the leaf nodes are assigned a class label (for classification) or a value (for regression).

### Problem Statement:
Given a dataset with features and target values, the goal is to build a decision tree that can **classify** data points into categories or **predict** continuous values based on the features. 

### Key Concepts:
- **Root Node**:  
  The top-most node in the tree, where the first feature split occurs.
  
- **Internal Nodes**:  
  Nodes where further feature splits occur based on the conditions.
  
- **Leaf Nodes**:  
  Terminal nodes that hold the final prediction (class or value).

### Split Criteria:
- **Gini Impurity** (for classification):  
  Measures the probability of a randomly chosen element being misclassified.

  Where \( p_i \) is the probability of the class label at node \( i \).

- **Entropy** (for classification):  
  Measures the disorder or impurity in the dataset.

  Where \( p_i \) is the proportion of data points in class \( i \).

- **Information Gain**:  
  Measures the reduction in entropy after a dataset is split on a feature.

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** (for regression):  
  Measures the variance between the predicted and actual values at each node.

### Time Complexity:
- **Best, Average, and Worst Case: $O(n \log n)$**  
  The time complexity depends on sorting the dataset at each node. For `n` data points, the overall complexity is logarithmic in depth with respect to the size of the dataset.

### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity: $O(n)$**  
  The space complexity arises from storing the tree structure and the data used for training.

### Example:
Consider a dataset for predicting whether someone buys a product based on their **age** and **income**:

- Dataset:
  ```  
  | Age   | Income  | Buys Product |  
  |-------|---------|--------------|  
  | 25    | High    | Yes          |  
  | 45    | Medium  | No           |  
  | 35    | Low     | Yes          |  
  | 22    | Low     | Yes          |  
  ```

Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Choose the best split**:  
   Using a criterion like Gini Impurity or Information Gain, the algorithm will decide which feature (Age or Income) provides the best split.
   
2. **Recursively split**:  
   It splits the data and continues until leaf nodes are formed, which represent the final decision (Yes/No for classification).

### Python Implementation:
Here is a basic implementation of a Decision Tree in Python using **scikit-learn**:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn import tree
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Create Decision Tree classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Train model
clf = clf.fit(X, y)

# Plot the tree
plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
tree.plot_tree(clf, filled=True, feature_names=iris.feature_names, class_names=iris.target_names)
plt.show()
```

### Summary:
The **Decision Tree Algorithm** is a simple yet powerful model that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Its ease of interpretation, ability to handle both categorical and numerical data, and non-parametric nature make it a versatile choice for many machine learning problems. However, decision trees are prone to **overfitting**, which can be mitigated by techniques like **pruning**, **random forests**, or **ensemble methods**.
