The **Tiling Problem** involves determining the number of ways to tile a given grid using dominoes (or similar tiles) of a fixed size. Specifically, in the **Domino Tiling** problem, the goal is to tile a `2 x n` grid using `1 x 2` dominoes. The dominoes can be placed either horizontally or vertically.

## Characteristics ‚ú®

- **Grid Tiling**:
  - The problem asks how to completely cover a grid without gaps or overlaps, using tiles of a fixed size.

- **Recursive Nature**:
  - The problem has a recursive structure, where solving the problem for smaller grids can help solve the larger grid.
  
- **Dynamic Programming Solution**:
  - The problem can be solved using dynamic programming to optimize the computation and avoid recalculating subproblems multiple times.

## Time Complexity ‚è±Ô∏è

- **Best Case: `O(n)`** üåü
  
  The problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming in linear time for a grid of size `2 x n`.

- **Average Case: `O(n)`** üîÑ
  
  The dynamic programming approach ensures that the time complexity remains linear regardless of the specific tiling configuration.

- **Worst Case: `O(n)`** üí•
  
  Even in the worst case, the time complexity remains linear since dynamic programming avoids redundant calculations.

## Space Complexity üíæ

- **Space Complexity: `O(n)`**  
  Requires linear space to store the solutions for subproblems in the dynamic programming table.

## C++ Implementation üíª

Here‚Äôs a simple implementation of the Domino Tiling problem using dynamic programming in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int tilingWays(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;

    vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1; // Base case: 1 way to tile a 2x0 grid
    dp[1] = 1; // Base case: 1 way to tile a 2x1 grid

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]; // Recursive relation
    }

    return dp[n];
}

int main() {
    int n = 5; // Grid size 2 x n
    cout << "Number of ways to tile the grid: " << tilingWays(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
## Applications of Tiling Problem üåê

- **Computer Graphics:**
    - Tiling problems are often encountered in computer graphics and image processing, where grids need to be covered with tiles or tiles need to be aligned.
- **Floor Planning:**
    - Used in architectural design to efficiently cover floor spaces with tiles or other materials.
- **Puzzles and Games:**
    - Many puzzle games or challenges involve tiling problems, like placing pieces in a grid to fit without gaps.
  
## Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:** ‚úÖ

- **Optimal Substructure:**
    - The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, making it suitable for dynamic programming.
- **Efficient Solution:**
    - The dynamic programming approach ensures that the problem can be solved efficiently in linear time.
  
**Disadvantages:** ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Memory Usage:**

    - The dynamic programming approach requires linear space, which can be inefficient for very large values of `n`.

- **Limited Grid Sizes:**

    - The solution applies specifically to `2 x n` grids; it may need adjustments for other grid sizes.
