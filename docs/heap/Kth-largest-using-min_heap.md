# Kth Largest Element Using Min Heap

A **Min Heap** based approach to find the Kth largest element in an unsorted array. This algorithm maintains a min heap of size K to efficiently track the K largest elements, where the root of the heap represents the Kth largest element.

## Introduction

The K-th largest element algorithm using a min heap is particularly useful when dealing with:
- Large datasets where we need to find top K elements
- Streaming data where elements arrive continuously
- Memory-constrained environments where we can't sort the entire array

The key idea is to maintain a min heap of size K, where the smallest element (root) represents the Kth largest element seen so far.

## Algorithm Overview

### Basic Concept

1. Create a min heap to store the K largest elements
2. Process elements one by one:
   - If heap size &lt; K: Insert the element
   - If heap size = K: Compare with root (smallest element)
     - If current element &gt; root: Remove root and insert current element
     - Otherwise: Skip the element
3. After processing all elements, the root contains the Kth largest element

### Visual Example
```
Array: [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4], K = 3

Step-by-step min heap construction:

1) [3]           2) [2,3]         3) [1,3,2]
   3               2               1
                  /               / \
                 3               3   2

4) [2,3,5]       5) [4,5,6]      Final: 4 is the 3rd largest
   2               4
  / \             / \
 3   5           5   6
```

## Implementation

### C++ Implementation
```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

class KthLargest {
private:
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;
    int k;

public:
    int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        this->k = k;
        
        // Process each element
        for (int num : nums) {
            // Add to heap if size < k
            if (minHeap.size() < k) {
                minHeap.push(num);
            }
            // If current element is larger than smallest element
            else if (num > minHeap.top()) {
                minHeap.pop();
                minHeap.push(num);
            }
        }
        
        return minHeap.top();
    }
};
```

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Build Heap: $O(n \cdot \log k)$
  - Get Kth largest: $O(1)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(k)$

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- Efficient for streaming data
- Memory efficient ($O(k)$ space)
- Good for large datasets where $k \ll n$
- Maintains running K largest elements

### Disadvantages
- Not optimal for small datasets
- Not suitable when K is close to n
- Requires rebuilding heap for dynamic K
