# Recursion Depth and Performance

Recursion depth can affect the performance and efficiency of your program. High depths increase memory usage and may lead to stack overflows. Here are ways to optimize recursive functions.

## Optimizing Recursive Functions
1. **Tail Recursion**: Some languages optimize tail-recursive functions to reduce stack usage.
2. **Memoization**: Store previous results to reduce duplicate calls, especially in algorithms like Fibonacci.
3. **Iterative Solutions**: Convert recursive functions to iterative when feasible.

## Example
In cases like calculating large Fibonacci numbers, use memoization to reduce depth.
