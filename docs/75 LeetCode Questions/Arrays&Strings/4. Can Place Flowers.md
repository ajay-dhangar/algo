## 605. Can Place Flowers
**Description**: 
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

### Example 1:

**Input:** flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
**Output:** true
### Example 2:

**Input:** flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
**Output:** false
 

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104
- flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
- There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
- 0 <= n <= flowerbed.length

**C++ Code**:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
      int size = flowerbed.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            // Check if current spot is empty and can plant a flower
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0) {
                // Check if the previous and next spots are empty or out of bounds
                bool leftEmpty = (i == 0) || (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0);
                bool rightEmpty = (i == size - 1) || (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0);
                
                if (leftEmpty && rightEmpty) {
                    // Plant a flower at the current spot
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    --n;
                    // Early exit if all flowers are planted
                    if (n == 0) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // After the loop, check if we were able to plant all the flowers
        return n <= 0;
    }
};

```
