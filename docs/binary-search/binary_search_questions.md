# Binary Search Patterns: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to this in-depth exploration of binary search patterns! This guide is designed to help you master the art of binary search through a curated collection of problems, explanations, and real-world applications.


## Introduction to Binary Search

Binary search is a fundamental algorithm in computer science that efficiently locates an element in a sorted array. By repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, binary search achieves a time complexity of O(log n), making it significantly faster than linear search for large datasets.

## Why Master Binary Search?

Understanding binary search is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Efficiency**: Binary search reduces time complexity from O(n) to O(log n), essential for working with large datasets.
2. **Versatility**: The core concept of dividing the search space applies to various problem types, from simple searches to complex optimization problems.
3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Mastering binary search enhances your ability to think algorithmically and approach problems systematically.
4. **Interview Preparation**: Binary search is a popular topic in technical interviews, appearing in questions from leading tech companies.
5. **Foundation for Advanced Algorithms**: Many advanced algorithms and data structures build upon the principles of binary search.

## Binary Search Patterns

### Pattern 1: Binary Search on 1D Arrays

This pattern focuses on applying binary search to one-dimensional sorted arrays. It covers:

- Basic binary search implementation
- Finding boundaries (first/last occurrences)
- Searching in rotated sorted arrays
- Finding peak elements

**Key Techniques**:
- Modifying search conditions
- Handling duplicate elements
- Identifying search spaces in modified arrays

### Pattern 2: Binary Search on Answer Space

This pattern applies binary search to a range of possible answers rather than a specific array. It's useful for:

- Optimization problems
- Finding roots of equations
- Minimizing/maximizing values subject to constraints

**Key Techniques**:
- Defining a feasible answer range
- Creating a condition to check answer validity
- Adjusting the search space based on the condition

### Pattern 3: Binary Search on 2D Arrays

This pattern extends binary search to two-dimensional arrays or matrices. It covers:

- Searching in row-wise and column-wise sorted matrices
- Finding peak elements in 2D arrays
- Calculating matrix medians

**Key Techniques**:
- Treating 2D arrays as flattened 1D arrays
- Utilizing properties of sorted rows/columns
- Combining binary search with other techniques (e.g., merge)
