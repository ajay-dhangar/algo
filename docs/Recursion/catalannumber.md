**Problem Statement:**

Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers with numerous applications in combinatorics. They are defined based on recursive relationships and can be interpreted in problems involving counting structures like valid sequences of parentheses, binary search trees, paths in grids, and polygon triangulations.

For example:

**Balanced Parentheses:** The nth Catalan number counts how many valid ways to arrange `n` pairs of parentheses. For `n = 3`, there are 5 valid sequences: `((())), ()(()), (())(), ()()(), (()())`.

**Binary Search Trees:** It represents the number of distinct binary search trees that can be constructed with `n` distinct elements.

**Recursive Definition:**

The recursive formula for Catalan numbers is:

$C(n) [i=0 to n−1] = [C(i)×C(n−i−1)]$ with the base case C(0)=1.

## Explanation:

- The recursive nature reflects how larger structures can be built from smaller ones. For example, in the case of valid parentheses sequences, placing a pair of parentheses at the outermost positions leaves a smaller valid subsequence inside and another valid subsequence after the outer parentheses.
- This recursive division is mirrored in the summation, where C(i) represents the number of valid structures in the left subsequence, and C(n−i−1) represents the right subsequence.

## Complexity :

**Dynamic Programming:** A more efficient approach is to use **dynamic programming** to store the results of previous computations in a table and reuse them, reducing the time complexity to $O(n^2)$. This avoids recalculating previously computed values and significantly improves performance.

**Closed-Form Formula:** Another alternative is to use the closed-form formula for Catalan numbers :

$C(n) = ( 1/n+1 ) \* ( 2n )$

Using this formula with precomputed binomial coefficients can provide a faster, non-recursive solution with $O(n)$ time complexity

### Limitations and Considerations

1. **Performance:** For larger values of `n`, the recursive approach will take significantly longer to compute. This is because of the exponential time complexity and the repeated computation of subproblems.
2. **Optimization:** If efficiency is a concern, switching to dynamic programming or using the closed-form formula is recommended for values of `n` larger than 20. These methods reduce the computational overhead and are more practical for larger inputs.
3. **Stack Depth:** Recursive approaches are also limited by the system's recursion depth limit, which may cause a stack overflow for very large values of `n` (though this is less of a concern for values up to 20).

**C++ implementation :**

**Output:**
```
Enter a value for n: 3
Catalan number C_3 is 5
```
```
Enter a value for n: 5
Catalan number C_5 is 42
```
**Code:**

```cpp
 #include <iostream>

unsigned long long catalan(int n)
{
    if (n == 0)
        return 1;

    unsigned long long result = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        result += catalan(i) * catalan(n - 1 - i);
    }

    return result;
}

int main()
{
    int n;

    std::cout << "Enter a value for n: ";
    std::cin >> n;

    if (n < 0)
    {
        std::cout << "n must be a non-negative integer." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    std::cout << "Catalan number C_" << n << " is " << catalan(n) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

```
