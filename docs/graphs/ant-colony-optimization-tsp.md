### Definition:
The **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm** is a **probabilistic optimization algorithm** inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It is widely applied to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

### Characteristics:
- **Swarm Intelligence**:
  - ACO is based on the collective behavior of ants that deposit pheromones on paths as they search for food, guiding other ants toward shorter paths over time.

- **Pheromone Trails**:
  - The algorithm uses pheromone trails to mark paths between cities. The amount of pheromone on a path reflects its desirability, guiding subsequent choices for other ants.

- **Heuristic Information**:
  - In addition to pheromone levels, ants consider a heuristic measure (e.g., distance) to select paths, striking a balance between exploration and exploitation.

- **Parameter Tuning**:
  - Parameters such as **alpha** (influence of pheromone), **beta** (influence of distance), and **evaporation rate** control the algorithmâ€™s convergence speed and solution quality.

### Python Implementation:
```python

import copy
import random

cities = {
    0: [0, 0],
    1: [0, 5],
    2: [3, 8],
    3: [8, 10],
    4: [12, 8],
    5: [12, 4],
    6: [8, 0],
    7: [6, 2],
}

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: O(N * ants_num * iterations_num)**  
  The time complexity depends on the number of cities (N), the number of ants (ants_num), and the number of iterations (iterations_num). 

### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity: O(N^2)**
  The algorithm requires storage for pheromone levels on all paths, resulting in a space complexity of O(N^2) for a fully connected graph.
  
### Summary:
The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm effectively tackles the Travelling Salesman Problem by simulating ant behavior with pheromone trails to find the shortest path. By balancing pheromone influence and heuristic distance measures, the algorithm iteratively improves routes, offering a practical solution for complex optimization challenges. This approach is highly valuable in network routing, scheduling, and various other optimization domains.
