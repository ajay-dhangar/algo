A two-dimensional (2D) array is an array of arrays, where each element of the main array is another array. It's often visualized as a table or matrix with rows and columns. Two-dimensional arrays are essential in various algorithmic problems, particularly when handling matrices, grids, and dynamic programming solutions.

In this guide, we will cover the fundamentals of two-dimensional arrays, their applications, and common operations used in data structures and algorithms (DSA).

## 1. What is a Two-Dimensional Array?

A two-dimensional array is an array that consists of a collection of elements arranged in rows and columns. Each element can be accessed using two indices – one representing the row and the other representing the column.

### Representation:

- A two-dimensional array can be visualized as:
  ```plaintext
  [a11, a12, a13]
  [a21, a22, a23]
  [a31, a32, a33]
  ```

Here, each row is an individual array, and all rows combined form the 2D array.

## 2. Declaration and Initialization of 2D Arrays

### Declaration:

In most programming languages, a 2D array is declared by specifying the number of rows and columns. For example, in C++:

```cpp title="C++"
int arr[3][4];  // Declares a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns
```

In Python, a 2D array can be initialized using nested lists:

```python title="Python"
arr = [[0] * 4 for _ in range(3)]  # Creates a 3x4 matrix filled with zeros
```

### Initialization:

2D arrays can be initialized at the time of declaration:

```cpp title="C++"
int arr[2][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6}
};
```

## 3. Accessing and Modifying Elements in a 2D Array

Each element in a 2D array is accessed using two indices – the first for the row and the second for the column.

### Example:

```cpp
int element = arr[1][2];  // Accesses the element at row 1, column 2
arr[0][1] = 10;           // Modifies the element at row 0, column 1
```

In Python:

```python
element = arr[1][2]
arr[0][1] = 10
```

## 4. Traversing a 2D Array

Traversing a 2D array involves visiting each element of the array. Typically, this is done using nested loops, where the outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the columns.

### Example in C++:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < columns; j++) {
        cout << arr[i][j] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

### Example in Python:

```python
for row in arr:
    for element in row:
        print(element, end=" ")
    print()
```

## 5. Common Operations on 2D Arrays

### a. Matrix Addition

Two matrices of the same dimensions can be added element-wise.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < columns; j++) {
        result[i][j] = matrix1[i][j] + matrix2[i][j];
    }
}
```

### b. Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication is performed by multiplying the rows of the first matrix by the columns of the second matrix.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < rowsA; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < colsB; j++) {
        result[i][j] = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < colsA; k++) {
            result[i][j] += matrixA[i][k] * matrixB[k][j];
        }
    }
}
```

### c. Transposing a Matrix

Transposing a matrix involves flipping its rows and columns.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < columns; j++) {
        transpose[j][i] = matrix[i][j];
    }
}
```

## 6. Applications of 2D Arrays in DSA

- **Dynamic Programming**: Many DP problems such as "Knapsack", "Longest Common Subsequence", and "Edit Distance" utilize 2D arrays to store solutions to subproblems.
- **Graph Representation**: Adjacency matrices use 2D arrays to represent graphs.
- **Image Processing**: A grayscale image can be represented as a 2D array of pixel intensities.
- **Game Boards**: Games like chess and tic-tac-toe use 2D arrays to represent the game board.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Matrix operations like addition, multiplication, and transposition are fundamental in linear algebra and often implemented using 2D arrays.

## 7. Example Problems

### Problem 1: Rotating a Matrix by 90 Degrees

Given a `n x n` matrix, rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.

### Problem 2: Spiral Matrix Traversal

Given a matrix, print the elements in a spiral order starting from the top-left corner.

### Problem 3: Find the Largest Island

Given a binary matrix where `1` represents land and `0` represents water, find the largest connected land mass (island).

### Problem 4: Matrix Multiplication

Write a program to multiply two matrices of dimensions `m x n` and `n x p`.
