### Definition:

The Rotate Array algorithm is used to shift the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of steps. This approach allows for efficient circular shifts, where elements that exceed the bounds of the array wrap around to the beginning.

### Characteristics:

- **Circular Shifting**:

  - The algorithm allows for elements to be moved to the front of the array when they exceed the array length, effectively wrapping around.

- **In-place Rotation**:

  - The algorithm can be implemented in a way that minimizes additional space usage, often achieving O(1) extra space complexity.

- **Efficient Time Complexity**:
  - The rotation can be performed in O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large datasets.

### Time Complexity:

- **Best, Average, and Worst Case: O(N)**

  - The time complexity is linear since each element in the array must be processed.

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**
  - The rotation can be performed in-place with constant extra space.

### Python Implementation:

```python
def rotate_array(arr, k):
    """
    Rotate the array to the right by k steps.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array to rotate.
        k (int): Number of steps to rotate the array to the right.

    Returns:
        list: Rotated array.
    """
    if not arr:
        return arr

    n = len(arr)
    k = k % n  # Handle cases where k > n

    # Rotate the array using slicing
    arr[:] = arr[-k:] + arr[:-k]

    return arr

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    k = 2
    rotated_arr = rotate_array(arr, k)
    print("Rotated array:", rotated_arr)  # Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```
