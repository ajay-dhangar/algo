## Sorting Algorithms

### Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

#### Example: Quick Sort

```javascript
function quickSort(arr) {
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;
  const pivot = arr[arr.length - 1];
  const left = arr.slice(0, -1).filter(x => x < pivot);
  const right = arr.slice(0, -1).filter(x => x >= pivot);
  return [...quickSort(left), pivot, ...quickSort(right)];
}
```
# Searching Algorithms
## Binary Search
Binary Search is a classic example of recursion in searching algorithms. It divides the search interval in half repeatedly until the target value is found.

#### Example: Binary Search
```javacsript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  function search(low, high) {
    if (low > high) return -1;
    const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
    if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
    return arr[mid] > target ? search(low, mid - 1) : search(mid + 1, high);
  }
  return search(0, arr.length - 1);
}
```
## Conclusion
Recursion is a powerful tool that finds applications in various sorting and searching algorithms. Mastering these practical uses can elevate your algorithmic skills.
