While recursion is a useful programming technique, it can lead to inefficiencies if not implemented correctly. Understanding how to optimize recursive functions is essential for better performance.

In this blog, weâ€™ll cover:

- **Memoization**: Caching results to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Tail Recursion**: A special case of recursion that can be optimized by the compiler.

## Memoization

Memoization is an optimization technique where you store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

### Example: Fibonacci with Memoization

```javascript
const memo = {};
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
  return memo[n];
}
```
### Tail Recursion
Tail recursion is when a function calls itself as its last action. Some programming languages can optimize tail recursive calls to avoid adding a new stack frame.

#### Example: Tail Recursive Factorial
```javascript
function factorial(n, accumulator = 1) {
  if (n <= 1) return accumulator;
  return factorial(n - 1, n * accumulator);
}
```
## Conclusion
By applying techniques like memoization and tail recursion, you can optimize your recursive algorithms for better performance, making your code faster and more efficient.
