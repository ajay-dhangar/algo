## What is Big O Notation?

Big O Notation describes the upper limit of an algorithm's growth rate, allowing us to express how the runtime or space requirements grow as the size of the input increases.

### Common Time Complexities:

1. **$O(1)$ - Constant Time**
2. **$O(n)$ - Linear Time**
3. **$O(log n)$ - Logarithmic Time**
4. **$O(n^2)$ - Quadratic Time**

## Example of Time Complexity Analysis

Consider a simple loop that calculates the sum of an array:

```javascript
function sumArray(arr) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let num of arr) {
    sum += num;
  }
  return sum;
}
```
The time complexity of this function is $O(n)$, where n is the length of the array.

## Space Complexity
In addition to time complexity, it's essential to consider space complexity, which measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size.

## Conclusion
Understanding Big O Notation is fundamental for analyzing algorithms and making informed decisions when selecting or designing them. By mastering this concept, you will improve your ability to evaluate algorithm performance effectively.
