When designing algorithms, a common question arises: should you use recursion or iteration? Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and understanding these can help you choose the right one for your problem.

In this blog, we'll compare:

- **Performance**: How recursion and iteration differ in execution time and space.
- **Readability**: The clarity of code in recursive vs. iterative solutions.

## Performance

### Recursion

- **Pros**: Easier to implement for problems that naturally fit a recursive structure, like tree traversals.
- **Cons**: May lead to stack overflow errors due to deep recursion. Higher space complexity due to function call stack.

#### Example: Recursive Fibonacci

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```
## Iteration
Pros: More memory-efficient as it avoids the overhead of recursive function calls. Generally faster for most problems.
Cons: Can be less intuitive for problems that have a natural recursive structure.

#### Example: Iterative Fibonacci

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  let a = 0, b = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    [a, b] = [b, a + b];
  }
  return b;
}
```
## Readability
Recursion often results in cleaner and more understandable code for problems that involve hierarchical structures, while iteration may require additional variables and conditions.

## Conclusion
Choosing between recursion and iteration depends on the specific problem you're tackling. Consider the trade-offs in performance and readability to make the best choice.
